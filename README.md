# Western Yugur
This is a personal repository of documentation of the Western Yugur language (ybe).
The audio, video, and photography relating to the language documentation are done by myself. All data is organised through Lameta and transcription is done in ELAN and Yubiao.

Below are links to bring you to the private YouTube page of the recordings. The transcription can be shown by turning on the captions, which are available with translation in English and Mandarin Chinese. The page is only accessible by clicking this link. The link will be removed when the ELDP results are announced. The corresponding glossing of the text will be available below when finished.

R01 contains a native speaker who watches and retells the _Pear films_.
